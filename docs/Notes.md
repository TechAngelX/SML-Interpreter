Create subclasses of the Instruction class that extend the Instruction class functionality. Do this ONLY AFTER completing methods in the Instruction class.

The Entry point for the programme - the Main method - RunSml Class.
Remember to override .equals() and .hashCode() for the subclasses.

Missing instruction classes that need to be implemented:
load  ✅
store ✅ Working on ....
push
add/sub/mul/div
if_cmpgt
if_cmpe

THOUGHTS: execute() seems to be prevalent for most of the instruction subclasses.
Perhaps make the execute method an interface?
